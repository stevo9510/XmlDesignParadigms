- Used data from some of the lecture notes, and made up some of my own.


* Part C:
- Two stations: Cinematic and Podcasts
- Cinematic station maps to actual *.mp3 files uploaded to server.
	- Note: Server was having trouble taking the full .mp3 file in some cases, so some of thme may have come in as partial.  However, the song will still play.
- Podcast station maps to actual url podcast endpoints.  They may take a moment to load since they're larger streamed files.
