			<h2>The Constant Gardener (m31)</h2>
			<p><img src="m31.jpg"></p>
      <p>This tale of political intrigue centers on Justin Quayle 	(Ralph Fiennes), a member of the British High Commission 	based in 	Africa, and his quest for truth. When his wife (Rachel Weisz, 	in an 	Oscar-winning turn for her supporting role) is murdered, 	Justin 	begins his own international investigation. Not even the 	rumors of 	his wife's affairs will stop him from uncovering the truth -- 	a 	conspiracy much larger and more dangerous than he'd imagined.</p>
